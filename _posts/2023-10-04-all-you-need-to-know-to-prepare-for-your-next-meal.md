## What I usually eat
### Breakfast
Usually have easy to cook or pre-cooked food for breakfast, so I can head to school asap.
- 🥚 Boiled egg + toasted whole wheat bread with light cream cheese + latte
- 🥣 Oatmeal
- 🫐 Yogurt bowl with berries, banana, granola, maple syrup, chia seed
- 🥟 Wonton or dumpling
- 🫓 Green chinese onion pancake 
- 🍜 Shanghai Spring onion oil noodles 

### Lunch
Usually pre-cook all the food and then frozon them into the fridge. So I can prepare a lot during weekend, and just heat them up at for lunch.

Easy to cook, maybe just need to mix all the ingredients and a timer, you don't need to be a master chef to cook them.

Always have spegetti or rice (refined carbs) for lunch, so I can have enough energy for the rest of the day.

Some food I usually have:
- 🍛 Curry chicken or beef
- 🍗 Steamed chicken with shiitake mushroom
- 🫑 Bell pepper with potato 🥔 and eggplant 🍆
- 🍅 Stir-fried chicken or beef with tomato and potato 🥔
- 🍝 Spegetti with tomato sauce or pesto sauce
- 🥪 Turkey ham + cheese + lettuce + tomato + whole wheat bread (during lazy days)
- Everything noodle
- Stir-fried noodle with chicken breast or beef or shrimp 🦐

### Dinner
I tried to avoid any refined carbs for dinner, and have more vegetables and protein.

Some food I usually have:
- Stir-fried cabbage with egg pancake
- Korean style tofo soup
- Stir-fried tofo with egg
- Vietnam style Spring roll

## Desert
- Peach gum with white fungus soup
- 🍡 Glutinous rice balls boiled in fermented wine
