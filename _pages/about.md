  👩‍🎓 &nbsp;Previously, I recieved a B.S. with Honors degree in Computer Science with Artificial intelligence from <a style="text-decoration:none" href = "https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/">University of Nottingham Ningbo China</a>. <br>
  💭 &nbsp;I like coding because it always results in something tangible. Seeing my programs run and help make lives easier brings me a lot of joy and excitement. The dynamic nature of this field, with its ever-evolving technologies and methodologies, promises a lifelong journey of learning and adapting, which I eagerly anticipate. I'm thrilled to keep learning and using new skills to solve problems with impactful solutions and make a difference. <br>
